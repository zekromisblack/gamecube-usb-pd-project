# gamecube-usb-pd-project
A write up of my project to add usb c power to the gamecube.


So i started this project when i saw [this on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gamecube/comments/sf5h0c/no_more_bulky_power_brick_welcome_to_2022_with/) but by looking into it, it appeared to have varying documentation on the methods and i wanted to go over what i did and hopefully make a definitive guide.


# Non 3d printed parts
1. A gamecube (duh)
    - Both the DOL-001 and the DOL-101 will work
2. A usb c pd module
    - I got my pd module from [here](https://www.ebay.com.au/itm/325333680483)
    - You can most likely get something similar in your country, but as i am based in australia i will post australian links from now on
    - any kind will work thats above 12 volts but i recommend a 15v-20v pd module for reasons i will go over later
3. A XL4015 dc to dc converter
    - I got my XL4015 module from [here](https://www.ebay.com.au/itm/304733979710)
    - this item is not required if you got the 12v module
    - you might want to get a heatsink for the module but isn't strictly required
4. Drills, files and sandpaper
    - pretty much any will do as long as they're tiny
    - you can most likely get them from your local hardware store
5. Soldering iron and equipment for soldering
    - good quality solder is key, preferably leaded solder (60/40) as that melts at a lower temprature than lead free solder and is generally easier to use
    - Flux is key! not using flux can easily ruin your day. i would suggest flux paste or a flux pen
    - a temperature controlled soldering iron will help by being able to solder as a comfortable temprature but isn't strictly required
6. some good quality wire
    - I used a mix of 1mm copper wire (18awg) and .80mm copper wire (20awg)
    - you can most likely go smaller but i haven't tested it so do it at your own risk
7. (OPTIONAL) 3d printer
    - allows you to print the 3d printed bracket i used which makes mounting easier
    - altertatively you can use a 3d printing service (most are paid so try checking your local libary to see if they have such a service available for free)
8. tape and hot glue
    - use for mounting both the usb c module and/or the mounting bracket and the XL4015 module if you require it
    - for tape use either kapton tape and/or double sided tape

# 3d printed parts
- See [here](https://github.com/MethodOrMadness/GC-USB-C)
    - Seems to only be supported on DOL-001 models so if you have a DOL-101 model and it works/doesn't work please let the original creator or me know so we can update it

# Steps
TBD (Update: Will be filled out with support from community members, circa mid 2024)
